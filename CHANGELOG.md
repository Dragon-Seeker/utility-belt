- Port to 1.20.6
    - It should be safe to update worlds from 1.20.4 to 1.20.6 **ON FABRIC** as a datafixer has been
      implemented
      to migrate from NBT to components, but as always make a backup in case.
    - If [Curios#411](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/411) is implemented, it will be
      safe to do so on Neoforge. For now, upgrading Neoforge worlds **WILL CAUSE LOSS OF ITEMS IN
      THE BELT**.
