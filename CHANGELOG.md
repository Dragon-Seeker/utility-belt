- Initial multiloader port.
- Feature parity with original Utility Belt, more features planned once the port is stable.
- Hopefully more stable than the original Utility Belt due to the complete rewrite, but bugs may still occur while we are in beta.

## **WARNING**: Utility Belt 2.0.0 is currently in a **BETA STATE**: backup your worlds and tread with caution! Please report any issues.
