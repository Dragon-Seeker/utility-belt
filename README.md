## How to Use

<div align="center">

![The recipe for the Utility Belt](https://cdn.jamalam.tech/mod-assets/utility-belt-recipe.png)

</div>

1. Craft a Utility Belt
2. Place it in your belt slot
3. Use `'` to open a GUI to manage the belt's contents.
4. Use `B` and `N` to switch between your regular hotbar and the belt. Crouch at the same time to swap items between the belt and your hotbar.

## How to Configure

Utility Belt can be configured via an in-game configuration screen which can be accessed in Mod Menu (Fabric/Quilt) or the mods screen (Forge/NeoForge).

## I think I found a bug!

Please report any issues you find on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/JamCoreModding/utility-belt). Until I reply, try out the `/utilitybelt fixme` command to see if it resolves the issue (but still report the problem if it does!).
